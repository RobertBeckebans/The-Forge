# ![The Forge Logo](Screenshots/TheForge-on-white.jpg)

The Forge is a cross-platform rendering framework supporting
- PC 
  * Windows 10 
     * with DirectX 12 / Vulkan 1.1
     * with DirectX Ray Tracing API
     * DirectX 11 Fallback Layer for Windows 7 support (not extensively tested)
  * Linux Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with Vulkan 1.1
- Android Pie with Vulkan 1.1
- macOS with Metal 2
- iOS with Metal 2
- XBOX One / XBOX One X (only available for accredited developers on request)
- PS4 (in development) (only available for accredited developers on request)

Particularly, The Forge supports cross-platform
- Descriptor management
- Multi-threaded resource loading
- Shader reflection
- Multi-threaded command buffer generation

Future plans are
- Unified shader generation -> check out an alpha version of the [Confetti Shader Translator](http://confettishadertranslator.azurewebsites.net). This shader translator is build with the purpose of supporting a higher-level shading language, which we call super HLSL or short sHLSL

The intended usage of The Forge is to enable developers to quickly build their own game engines. The Forge can provide the rendering layer for custom next-gen game engines.

# News

## Release 1.19 - November 1st, 2018 - Material Playground
* Added more materials to the Material Playground. Therefore you want to download the Art folder again just for this release (see the Install section below on how to do this).
Here are shots of five of the supported platforms:

![Material Playground on XBOX One](Screenshots/MaterialPlayground/05-Xbox-One-1920x1080.png)

* Updated Fontstash library to the latest version and added .OTF font file support
* macOS / iOS Metal 2 we are working on applications running on those run-times, so there is a constant stream of improvmements coming in:
  * Sampler arrays
  * Enable some parts of GPU profiler code for debug markers, cpu timestamps on Metal runtime
  * File system bug fixes
  * Include headers fixes
  * Improved error and warnings in Metal shaders


## Release 1.18 - October 18th, 2018 - Animation System Ozz support | Vulkan native Ubuntu Linux package support
* The Forge now uses the Ozz animation system. This is our first major change to the math library because we needed to add what is necessary for animation. We compared the speed of our math library then with the speed of the Ozz animation system math library and they are about the same. At some point we need to do AVX 1 and ARM specific optimizations to our math library, which is still based on the open-sourced changed Sony math library [Vectormath](https://github.com/glampert/vectormath), which is similar to the Bullet math library ... 
  
A screenshot of the PC version:

![Ozz Baked Physics on iPhone](Screenshots/Ozz_iphone.png)

XBOX One:
![Ozz Baked Physics on iPhone](Screenshots/Ozz_xbox_BakedPhysics.png)

We added several unit tests for Ozz. Please find descriptions below.

* Extended the file system for all platforms, making it more consistent to use and more functional
* Tabified - tabified the whole code base ... finally ... 
* glTF - we made sure glTF 2.0 support is improved in the latest assimp we use. This should allow us in the future to use glTF 2.0 art assets easier
* Linux / Vulkan - we applaud Khronos for the native Ubuntu Linux package for all the elements of the Vulkan SDK [LunarG Vulkan SDK Packages for Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04](https://packages.lunarg.com/) and will support those from now on. This is something that makes gaming on Linux Ubuntu easier to approach for end-users.
* macOS
  * we have a hard time to get the "Wave Intrinsics unit test" running. It runs now on our MacBook Pro test machines with Intel GPUs but not on the iMacs with AMD GPUs. It throws compile errors on the iPhone 7. We are providing Apple with info on their bug tracker.
  * upgraded to Xcode Version: 10.0 (10A255) and MacOS Version: 10.14 (18A389) 
* iOS 
  * there are numerous improvements for the input system, imGUI and other things
  * support shader includes on iOS like on the other platforms
* Android Pie & Vulkan 1.1 - we are waiting for devkits with better driver support before we move on with this target platform
* XBOX One - see internal GitLab list for improvements as usual ...


## Release 1.17 - October 4th, 2018 - Android Pie & Vulkan 1.1 Support  | iOS imGUI touch & virtual keyboard | DXR Ray Tracing support | Call for contributors to change IRenderer.h
* The Forge now has initial support for Android with the same Vulkan 1.1 run-time that is used by the Windows and Linux platforms. 

![Android running Vulkan 1.1 ](Screenshots/Compute_Android.png)

There are only a few phones that support Vulkan 1.1. We developed and support the 
[Essential Phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_Phone).
This phone uses an Adreno 540 GPU and can be obtained relatively cheap and unlocked from Amazon or similar sources. Please check out [Vulkan Gpuinfo.org](http://vulkan.gpuinfo.org/) for the supported feature list of this GPU with Android 9.0.
At the moment only the first two unit tests are running but we will extend the support to as many as we can in an upcoming release. We expect to run into driver bugs. We will not actively support Vulkan 1.0.
* Vulkan - mobile phone support see above
* iOS: 
  * upgraded to 12.0 (16A366)
  * we extended imGUI support for iOS with touch support and virtual keyboard
* Windows - fixed resizing ... should now work again with Alt+Enter ...
* Windows DXR - The Forge was the first rendering framework to support DXR, now that there will be hardware support, we added a screenshot of one of the unit tests below. We will add support for the other Ray Tracing APIs as well. They are useful for developing Tools. For games we recommend the Hybrid Ray-Traced solutions provided below (so far only shadows).

![Image of the DXR Ray Tracing unit test in The Forge](Screenshots/16_RayTracing.png)

* Upgraded the Order-Independent Transparency unit test to support Phenomenological Transparency as described in one of Morgan McGuire's papers. Here are screenshots:

![OIT Refraction ](Screenshots/OIT_refraction.png)

Phenomenological Transparency - Refraction

![OIT diffusion ](Screenshots/OIT_diffusion.png)

Phenomenological Transparency - Diffusion

![OIT diffusion, refraction, shadows ](Screenshots/OIT_diffusion_refraction_shadows.png)

Phenomenological Transparency - Diffusion, Refraction, Shadows

* Linux - the wave intrinsics unit test now also works on Linux. We are looking into macOS / iOS next.
* Call for contributors to change IRenderer.h - as a heads-up, we will change the renderer interface to use our own way of "Render Passes and Compute Passes" similar to the Vulkan render passes. We will analyze render and compute calls and use this information to expose data to a "Render Graph" that will be implemented on a higher level. If you want to be part of the group that thinks about how we should adjust IRenderer.h for this, please send Wolfgang a note and your skype ID


See the release notes from previous releases in the [Release section](https://github.com/ConfettiFX/The-Forge/releases).

  
# PC Windows Requirements:

1. Windows 10 with latest update

2. Drivers
* AMD / NVIDIA - latest drivers should work. On Vulkan, at least NVIDIA Beta Driver 389.20 are required to support Linked Multi-GPU. 
* Intel - need to install the latest driver (currently Version: 25.20.100.6326, October 9th, 2018) [Intel® Graphics Driver for Windows® 10](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/28240/Intel-Graphics-Driver-for-Windows-10?product=80939). As mentioned before this driver still doesn't have full DirectX 12 and Vulkan support.


3. Visual Studio 2017 with Windows SDK / DirectX version 16299.91 (Fall Creators Update)
https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/sdk-archive

4. Vulkan [1.1.82.1](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home)


5. Ray Tracing 
 * DirectX Raytracing Experimental SDK v0.09.01
 * Windows 10 RS4 builds more info at [DXR](http://aka.ms/DXR)

6. The Forge is currently tested on 
* AMD 5x, VEGA GPUs (various)
* NVIDIA GeForce 9x, 10x GPUs (various)
* Intel Skull Canyon

# macOS Requirements:

1. macOS: 10.14 (18A389)

2. XCode: 10.0 (10A255)

3. The Forge is currently tested on the following macOS devices:
* iMac with AMD RADEON 560 (Part No. MNDY2xx/A)
* iMac with AMD RADEON 580 (Part No. MNED2xx/A)
* MacBook Pro 13 inch (MacBookPro13,2) 
* Macbook Pro 13 inch (MacbookPro14,2)

In the moment we do not have access to an iMac Pro or Mac Pro. We can test those either with Team Viewer access or by getting them into the office and integrating them into our build system.
We will not test any Hackintosh configuration. 


# iOS Requirements:

1. iOS: 12.0 (16A366)

2. XCode: see macOS

To run the unit tests, The Forge requires an iOS device with an A9 or higher CPU (see [GPU Processors](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DeviceInformation/Reference/iOSDeviceCompatibility/HardwareGPUInformation/HardwareGPUInformation.html) or see iOS_Family in this table [iOS_GPUFamily3_v3](https://developer.apple.com/metal/Metal-Feature-Set-Tables.pdf)). This is required to support the hardware tessellation unit test and the ExecuteIndirect unit test (requires indirect buffer support). The Visibility Buffer doesn't run on current iOS devices because the [texture argument buffer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/fundamental_components/gpu_resources/understanding_argument_buffers) on those devices is limited to 31 (see [Metal Feature Set Table](https://developer.apple.com/metal/Metal-Feature-Set-Tables.pdf) and look for the entry "Maximum number of entries in the texture argument table, per graphics or compute function") , while on macOS it is 128, which we need for the bindless texture array. 

We are currently testing on 
* iPhone 7 (Model A1778)
* iPad (Model A1803)

# Install 
For PC Windows run PRE_BUILD.bat. For the other platforms run the shell script. It will download and unzip the art assets and only on PC install the shader builder extension for Visual Studio 2017.

# Unit Tests
There are the following unit tests in The Forge:

## 1. Transformation

This unit test just shows a simple solar system. It is our "3D game Hello World" setup for cross-platform rendering.

![Image of the Transformations Unit test](Screenshots/01_Transformations.PNG)

## 2. Compute

This unit test shows a Julia 4D fractal running in a compute shader. In the future this test will use several compute queues at once.

![Image of the Compute Shader Unit test](Screenshots/02_Compute.PNG)

## 3. Multi-Threaded Rendering

This unit test shows how to generate a large number of command buffers on all platforms supported by The Forge. This unit test is based on [a demo by Intel called Stardust](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/using-vulkan-graphics-api-to-render-a-cloud-of-animated-particles-in-stardust-application).

![Image of the Multi-Threaded command buffer generation example](Screenshots/03_MultiThreading.PNG)

## 4. ExecuteIndirect

This unit test shows the difference in speed between Instanced Rendering, using ExecuteIndirect with CPU update of the indirect argument buffers and using ExecuteIndirect with GPU update of the indirect argument buffers.
This unit test is based on [the Asteroids example by Intel](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/asteroids-and-directx-12-performance-and-power-savings).

![Image of the ExecuteIndirect Unit test](Screenshots/04_ExecuteIndirect.PNG)

## 5. Font Rendering

This unit test shows the current state of our font rendering library that is based on several open-source libraries.

![Image of the Font Rendering Unit test](Screenshots/05_FontRendering.PNG)

## 6. Material Playground

This unit test will show a wide range of game related materials in the future.

![Material Playground on PC](Screenshots/MaterialPlayground/01-PC-Vulkan-1920x1080.png)

## 7. Hardware Tessellation

This unit test showcases the rendering of grass with the help of hardware tessellation.

![Image of the Hardware Tessellation Unit test](Screenshots/07_Hardware_Tessellation.PNG)

## 8. Procedural 
In the spirit of the shadertoy examples this unit test shows a procedurally generated planet.

![Image of the Procedural Unit test](Screenshots/08_Procedural.PNG)

## 9. Light and Shadow Playground
This unit test shows various shadow and lighting techniques that can be chosen from a drop down menu. There will be more in the future.

![Image of the Light and Shadow Unit test](Screenshots/09_LightShadowPlayground.png)

## 9a. Hybrid Ray-Traced Shadows
This unit test was build by Kostas Anagnostou @KostasAAA to show how to ray trace shadows without using a ray tracing API like DXR / RTX. It should run on all GPUs (not just NVIDIA RTX GPUs) and the expectation is that it should run comparable with a DXR / RTX based version even on a NVIDIA RTX GPU. That means the users of your game do not have to buy a NVIDIA RTX GPU to enjoy HRT shadows :-)
![Hybrid Ray Traced Shadows](Screenshots/09a_HRT_Shadows.png)


## 10. Pixel-Projected Reflections
This unit test shows reflections that are ray traced. It is an implementation of the papers [Optimized pixel-projected reflections for planar reflectors](http://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2017/PixelProjectedReflectionsAC_v_1.92.pdf) and [IMPLEMENTATION OF OPTIMIZED PIXEL-PROJECTED REFLECTIONS FOR PLANAR REFLECTORS](https://github.com/byumjin/Jin-Engine-2.1/blob/master/%5BByumjin%20Kim%5D%20Master%20Thesis_Final.pdf)

![Image of the Pixel-Projected Reflections Unit test](Screenshots/10_Pixel-ProjectedReflections.png)

## 11. Multi-GPU (Driver support only on PC Windows)
This unit test shows a typical VR Multi-GPU configuration. One eye is rendered by one GPU and the other eye by the other one.

![Image of the Multi-GPU Unit test](Screenshots/11_MultiGPU.png)

## 12. The Forge switching between Vulkan and DirectX 12 during Run-time (Windows PC-only)
